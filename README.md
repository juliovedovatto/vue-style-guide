# Vue Style Guide

I created this repository to store my personal Style Guide for Vue 2/3 projects.

The main intent is to help to quickly configure a new project and or help a team setting/improve code style.

This is based on my experiences, it should **not** reflect what is correct or not. Sometimes what works for my perspective doesn't work for yours.
